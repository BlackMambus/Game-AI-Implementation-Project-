# Game-AI-Implementation-Project-

Game AI implementation refers to the techniques and systems that give in-game entities‚Äîsuch as characters, enemies, allies, and even environments‚Äîthe ability to behave in a responsive, believable, and challenging way. It simulates decision-making, strategy, and adaptability to elevate gameplay experience.

üß† Core Components:
Pathfinding Algorithms: Enable characters to move intelligently across terrain (e.g. A*, NavMesh).

Finite State Machines (FSMs): Organize behavior into discrete states like patrol, attack, flee.

Decision Trees & Behavior Trees: Create layered, conditional decision-making systems for nuanced character behavior.

Fuzzy Logic: Allows AI to make human-like judgments instead of binary choices.

Machine Learning (optional): Used in advanced games for dynamic learning and evolving gameplay strategies.

‚öîÔ∏è Common Applications:
Enemy combat tactics (e.g. flanking, defending, pursuing)

NPC dialog and reactions

Dynamic difficulty adjustments

Squad coordination and team-based behavior

Real-time strategy opponent planning
